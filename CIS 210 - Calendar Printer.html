  <h1>Assignment 3, part 1: Printing a calendar</h1>
<p>This assignment is due at 5pm on Friday, October 14.  Use
  Canvas to turn calpr.py in electronically.</p>
<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>Sometimes we can't write a single loop that processes a whole
  collection.  We may need to treat the first and/or the last elements
  separately from those in the middle.  
  Such algorithms are often called
  “fencepost algorithms”, because there is a first
  fencepost, then several full sections of fence separated by
  fenceposts, then a last fencepost.  This project is to think through
  a fencepost algorithm:  printing the first (partial) week of a
  month, then the full weeks, then the last (partial) week. 
  </p>

<h1>Pair Assignment</h1>
  <p>You are encouraged to use <em>pair programming</em> to
  complete this assignment. Work together with one classmate.
  </p>
  <p>Before writing code at the computer, you should work together and
  independently on the design.  Each of you should be able to clearly
  explain how the program or a part of the program will work.  
  When you are convinced that you both understand how the code will
  work, then and only then are you ready to write the code.</p>
</div>


<div class="item">
<h1>Printing a calendar</h1>
  <p>Calendars are traditionally organized into weeks, beginning (at
  least in the U.S.) on Sunday.  The first and last week may be
  partial, as in October 2013: 
</p>
<pre> Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
        1  2  3  4  5
  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
 27 28 29 30 31
</pre>


  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>Your program will take two integers, a month number (1-12) and a
  year number (1-2100) from the command line.  It will then print a
  calendar in (exactly) the format shown above.  For example: 
  </p>
<kbd>
<pre>&gt; python3 calpr.py 11 2013
 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
                 1  2
  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
</pre></kbd>

<p>We will use the datetime module of the Python library to determine
  which day of the week a month starts on.  We will not use the
  calendar module ... because it has a function to completely lay out
  the calendar, and the point is for us to write that ourselves.
  </p>

  <p>To avoid additional complexity, we will treat February as always
  having 28 days, even in leap years, and all months having their
  current lengths.  (We are ignoring alternative and
  earlier versions of the calendar,
  and some historical adjustments.  For example, in 1712 February had
  30 days, but we will treat it as if it had 28.)
  </p>

 
<h1>Notes and hints on the calendar printer</h1>
  <p>I have provided
  <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/calpr.py">quite a bit of starter code</a>; your task
  is to figure out the logic of breaking a month down into a
  starting week, full weeks in the middle, and (possibly) a partial
  ending week.  I have provided some pseudocode to help, but it will
  take careful thinking and design (and, almost certainly, a few
  rounds of testing and revision) to turn it into code that works
  correctly.</p>

  <p>The initial loop that I have provided demonstrates how to
  print some parts of a line without moving to a new line. This
  involves using a “keyword argument” <kbd>end=""</kbd>.
  It also uses the <kbd>format</kbd> function to make each day
  number print right-justified in a field of exactly 3 characters. 
  </p>
  
  <p>Please name your program file <tt>calpr.py</tt>.  Consistent
  naming makes life a little easier for your grader, and helps him
  return graded homeworks to you faster. Follow the format
  above precisely.</p>

<div class="item">
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>35 points possible</p>
  <ul>
    <li>15: Program runs and consistently produces correct
    output for any month and year from January 1800 to
    December 2525.   
    </li>

    <li>10: Follows <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/handouts/styleguide.php">CIS 210 coding guidelines</a>, including author
    identification and header .</li>
    <li>10: Clarity.  The program should not only be consistent with
    the requirements and approach described here, but it should be
    very easy to read the program and verify its consistency with the
    spec. </li>
   </ul>
